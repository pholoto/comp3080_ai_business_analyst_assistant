\chapter{SYSTEM TESTING AND ANALYSIS}


Chapter 4 provides an overview of the implementation and testing phases of the proposed Capstone project. This chapter is dedicated to explaining how the project will be executed, the system will be tested, and the obtained results will be analyzed and discussed in the second semester. The following subsections guide the presentation of this information: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Briefly provide the systematic approach used to conduct system testing (if prototype) amd simulating (if simulation). The testing phase aims to verify the functionality, reliability, and performance of the implemented solution. 
\item Briefly describe the different types of tests performed, including unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.
\end{itemize}
