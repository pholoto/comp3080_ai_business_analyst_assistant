I would like to express my deep and sincere gratitude to my research supervisor, \emph{\Supervisor}, for giving me the opportunity to do research and providing invaluable guidance throughout this work. His dynamism, vision, sincerity and motivation have deeply inspired me. He has taught me the methodology to carry out the work and to present the works as clearly as possible. It was a great privilege and honor to work and study under his guidance. 

I am greatly indebted to my honorable teachers of the Department of \College at the \University who taught  me during the course of my study. Without any doubt, their teaching and guidance have completely transformed me to a person that I am today.

I am extremely thankful to my parents for their unconditional love, endless prayers, caring and immense sacrifices for educating and preparing me for my future. I would like to say thanks to my friends and relatives for their kind support and care.

Finally, I would like to thank all the people who have supported me to complete the project work directly or indirectly.
